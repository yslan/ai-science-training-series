# Neural Networks in Python

Author: Bethany Lusch, combining and adapting materials evolved over time by Asad Khan, Prasanna Balaprakash, Taylor Childers, Corey Adams, Kyle Felker, and Tanwi Mallick 

This tutorial covers the basics of neural networks (aka "deep learning"), which is a technique within machine learning. We will learn about the mathematics of neural networks by building them "by hand." In next week's tutorial, we will learn about how to use the higher-level functions in the Python module TensorFlow. 

We'll start with an image classification problem in this notebook: 
[Fitting MNIST with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)](01_introduction_mlp.ipynb)




## Environment Setup
1. If you are using ALCF, first log in. From a terminal run the following command:
```
ssh username@theta.alcf.anl.gov
```

2. Although last week we cloned the repo, you'll want the updated version. To be reminded of last week's instructions for syncing your fork, click [here](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/ai-science-training-series/blob/main/00_introToAlcf/03_githubHomework.md). 

3. Now that we have the updated notebooks, we can open them. If you are using ALCF JupyterHub, you can be reminded of the steps [here](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/ai-science-training-series/blob/main/00_introToAlcf/02_jupyterNotebooks.md). 

4. Change the notebook's kernel to `conda/2022-07-01` (you may need to change kernel each time you open a notebook for the first time):

    1. select *Kernel* in the menu bar
    1. select *Change kernel...*
    1. select *conda/2022-07-01* from the drop-down menu
